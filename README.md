## Hi there 👋🏽

I'm Jenny👋🏽 My pronouns are she/her.

I've done a bunch of stuff at a bunch of companies so far (see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/imjennyli/)) but I'm currently working on making youth sports fun for kids and coaches at [MOJO Sports](https://www.mojo.sport/). 

## Human User Guide
Something my org does is write these 'human user guides' to tell folks a little about themselves and how they like to work. Here's mine, posted here for durability.

### About me

#### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

* I love automated linters and formatters. Anything that minimizes conventions I have to consciously follow is `:chef-kiss:`.
* Food is my love language and the gym is my escape. There's just nothing that feels better than lifting some heavy sh*t when you're frustrated.
* I thought I was a cat person all my life, and then I met my heart dog. His name is Wilson <3. We recently had to say goodbye to him, and it was incredibly hard to only have spent 3 years with him (he was an old rescue).
* A flexible work schedule works best for me. I typically work ~7-5 with a couple longer breaks in the day to relax. I'm always reachable by text or PagerDuty if something is urgent.

#### What drives you nuts?

* Having the same meeting over and over again and getting nowhere. I love incremental progress.
* When people aren't considerate of others' time.
* My own hoarder / clutter tendencies. I have a hard time throwing _anything_ away, on the off chance it'll be useful again in 5 years. Yes, I tried to read Marie Kondo, and no it did not work.

#### What are your quirks?

* I'm pretty much always eating during meetings (muted, of course). :chompy: If it's not a meal, it's a tasty snack like kettle corn.
* I'm a tab-hoarder. I'm working on it. On any given day, I probably have 5-10 windows open, each with 3-30 tabs open (I wish I was exaggerating). Every so often, I burn it all down and close all the windows to start fresh.
* I lose track of time / get into flow state pretty easily. If I'm ever more than a couple mins late to a meeting without giving you a heads up - it's probably because I got distracted and I would appreciate a gentle nudge on slack!

#### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

* Words of affirmation don't always come naturally to me but I'm working on it! It can sometimes be hard for me to express how excited and enthusiastic I am about something, and I hate it when people don't know how happy or excited I am about their work.
* I might send you messages at random times, but I never expect someone to respond when it's not within their normal working hours. I try to preface messages with acknowledgement of such.
* I sometimes come off as having strong opinions. I do, but am very open to different ideas and would love to hear yours.
* tbd. Tell me about a misconception you had about me when we met!

### About my colleagues

#### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?

* I value kindness, empathy, humility, and being a team player:
  * Don't be a 'brilliant jerk'
  * Try to understand someone else's point of view
  * Do your part and help your teammates out
* I particularly value colleagues who are tenacious and persistent in digging into systems they don't (yet) understand, and subsequently share what they learn with the team.

#### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?

* Create PRs with no context or description. We spend lots of time spelunking through code, and seeing one line prs that don't explain reasoning doesn't help me or anyone else understand what is going on.
* Block a PR on nits. I'm in the camp of, "do not let perfection stand in the way of progress"
* Create meetings without agendas.. or create meetings that could have been a quick discussion in some slack channel.

#### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?

* Gimme feedback about how I can do something better, technical or otherwise!
* Tell me about something cool you learned during #day-of-learning, *especially* if it's not work-related
* Send me memes or pictures of your cat/dog/other type of pet

### About my interactions

#### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?

* I like to provide as much context as I can to explain why something needs to be done, or why I think it needs to be done a certain way.
* I like to have discussions and understand what you're thinking/feeling and why.
* Something I'm working on in particular is asking more questions and trying to help you guide yourself to the solution or path forward.

#### What’s the best way to communicate with you?

* Slack is good. I'm still getting used to the firehose that is GitHub notifications.
* If you want to chat face to face, feel free to just set up time on my calendar any time I'm free, you don't have to ask me :)

#### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?

* Explaining your reasoning, and showing me you've considered tradeoffs.
* And asking nicely :)

#### How do you like to give feedback?

* For positive feedback, I'll generally slack DM or in the team channel, depending on the context.
* Otherwise, I feel most comfortable giving constructive feedback in regular 1:1s. I'm very sensitive of making someone nervous by dropping an ad-hoc 1:1 onto their calendar.
* If I don't have regular 1:1s with you, I will probably slack you and try to set up time to chat on Zoom.
* I promise I will always try to make it actionable, and tie it back to your career goals as much as possible.

#### How do you like to get feedback?

* Face to face is best, unless it's a general thumbs up on something I did that you liked. Then slack or sparkles are perfect.
